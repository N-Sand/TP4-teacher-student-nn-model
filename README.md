# TP4-teacher-student-nn-model
Used for the research of single layer neural networks via student-teacher model in the sparse and spherically symmetric regimes.
Can be used to show that krandom feature learners (which behave like kernal regression/classification in the limit of infinite width) outperform feature learning networks in regimes where the teacher is spherically symmetric (covers a sphere in weight space).
